## Introduction
Have you ever felt like playing a round of [Gwent](http://witcher.wikia.com/wiki/Gwent) from [_The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_](http://thewitcher.com/en/witcher3)? Not on the computer against the same old AI opponents, but rather against human challengers? Then craft your very own Gwent card set (**for non-commercial, personal use only**). You can print the cards yourself or let them be printed for you (e.g. [PrinterStudio](http://www.printerstudio.com/personalized/bridge-size-custom-cards-blank-cards.html)).

**Note**: [_CD Projekt RED_](http://en.cdprojektred.com/) recently launched the [Gwent](https://www.playgwent.com/en/) open beta, which is a standalone game based on the Gwent mini game from [_The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_](http://thewitcher.com/en/witcher3). The major game mechanics are kept the same, but the cards themselves differ and are balanced for PvP (as opposed to PvE). 

## What is Gwent?
In the perhaps most fantastic RPG currently available, [_The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_](http://thewitcher.com/en/witcher3), there is again plenty of distraction next to the monster hunting and the main storyline. Among other things, you can challenge the residents to play cards. You begin with a very weak starting deck and earn new, more powerful cards during the game.

But why only compete against NPCs if you could also play with friends?

## How do you play Gwent?
Gwent is a card game for two players (originally intended for multiple players). The aim of the game is to beat your opponent using one’s own deck by ensuring that the total strength of your cards on the board is greater than that of your opponent’s in two out of three rounds. During the game, various unit cards can be placed in one of three corresponding tiers: 
1. _Close Combat_;
2. _Ranged Combat_;
3. _Siege Combat_. 

The sum of the played cards strength decides which player wins the round itself. _Bonus_ (including _weater_) cards can also change the strength of the played cards decisively.

All rounds of a match must be played with the same starting hand. Mastering how to use your available cards sparingly is the key to victory.

## Repository Features
* A library of Gwent cards (including raw textures);
* Some utilities for manipulating Gwent cards.

## Recommendations
* We recommend to use the same backside image for all cards. This way only two sets of _Neutral Unit_ cards are required instead of one for each fraction (or two for each fraction if you cannot choose between the original and alternative design).
* We recommend to use the cards with color bleeding applied to the border if you let the cards be printed for you (e.g. [PrinterStudio](http://www.printerstudio.com/personalized/bridge-size-custom-cards-blank-cards.html)).

## Notes
* 4x _Commander's Horn_ can be contained in one's deck of which one is implicit via for example _Eredin King of the Wild Hunt_
* 5x _Blue Stripes Commando_ can be contained in one's deck according to the digital game, unfortunately only 3 different textures are available.
* Special abilities and strengths are based on the digital game not on the limited edition card set produced by [_CD Projekt RED_](http://en.cdprojektred.com/).
* _Bovine Defense Force_ can only be triggered in the next round via _Cow_ (see [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKKlnXvIDxs)).
